Bucket
=============

Bucket was a project Kevin Gibbon, Joshua Scott, Brad Griffith and Michael Risse put together for the AngelHack Hackathon Dec. 2012.

Bucket was tripit for tickets. As soon as a ticket ends up in your gmail, Bucket automatically transfers it to your Apple passbook on your iPad or iPhone.
